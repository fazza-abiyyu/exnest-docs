Welcome to **Exnest AI**, a unified API platform for developers who want to access multiple AI providers with ease.

## What is Exnest AI?

Exnest AI is a backend service that brings together OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and other AI models into a single, developer-friendly API.  
Instead of juggling multiple accounts, currencies, and billing systems, Exnest lets you top-up in **Indonesian Rupiah (IDR)** via **Midtrans**, manage usage transparently, and integrate securely.

We built Exnest AI to solve the pain points developers face when working with global AI providers:  

- USD-only payments that donâ€™t work locally ðŸ’µ  
- Expensive minimum deposits ðŸ’³  
- Inconsistent APIs across providers ðŸ§©  

With Exnest, you can just **build smarter and faster**.

## Key Features

Exnest AI includes a range of features designed for developers and teams:

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Access OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and more with one API key.  
- **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.  
- **Local Payment Integration (IDR)**: Top-up using Midtrans with bank transfer, e-wallet, or QRIS.  
- **Transparent Billing**: Usage-based tracking and detailed usage reports.  
- **Developer SDKs**: Official TypeScript SDKs and REST endpoints ready to go.  
- **Failover Handling**: Automatic routing to backup providers to minimize downtime.  
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed insights into usage, cost, and performance.  
- **Dark Mode**: Because devs love dark mode ðŸŒ™
