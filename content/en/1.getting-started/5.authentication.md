# Authentication & Universal Connector

Exnest supports both Exnest API keys (prefixed with `ex-sk`) and official provider API keys through the Universal Connector feature. This allows you to:

1. Use your existing API keys from providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
2. Still benefit from Exnest's unified API interface
3. Optionally use Exnest's billing and management features when using Exnest API keys

### Using Exnest API Keys (with billing)

```typescript
const exnest = new ExnestAI({
  apiKey: 'ex-sk-your-exnest-api-key'
});

const response = await exnest.chat('gpt-4.1-mini', [
  { role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }
]);
```

### Using Official Provider API Keys (without billing)

```typescript
const exnest = new ExnestAI({
  apiKey: 'sk-your-openai-api-key'
});

const response = await exnest.chat('gpt-4.1-mini', [
  { role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }
]);
```
